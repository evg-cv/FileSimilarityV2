"Any polished or a shiny surface can act as a mirror. A mirror changes the direction of light that falls on it. This change of direction by a mirror is called reflection of light. Concave and Convex mirrors are called as spherical mirrors.  If the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is concave, it is called a concave mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex, then it is a convex mirror. In Convex mirrors , images are erect, i.e. straight, and smaller in size. Whereas in Concave mirrors, the image is inverted. another observation is,  in Convex mirrors, image looks near and in concave the image looks far. A convex lens converges (bends inward) the light generally falling on it. Therefore, it is called a converging lens. On the other hand, a concave lens diverges (bends outward) the light and is called a diverging lens. Convex mirrors deflect light and , in Concave mirrors the light is concentrated at one point. Concave mirrors are used variously for: (a) doctors using concave mirrors for examining eyes, ears, nose and throat (b) dentists to see an enlarged image of the teeth (c) reflectors of torches, headlights of cars and scooters Convex mirrors are used in the below applications: (a) These are used as side mirrors in scooters, cars etc. Convex mirrors can form images of objects spread over a large area. So, these help the drivers to see the traffic behind them. ","Mirror refers to any smooth polished or shining surface, that can reflect the light beam and form images. It can be of two types, i.e. plane mirror and a spherical mirror. The mirror whose reflecting surface is flat is a plane mirror whereas a mirror with the curved reflecting surface is termed as a spherical mirror. A spherical mirror is of two types, i.e. convex mirror and a concave mirror. A convex mirror has a reflecting surface that bulges outside. On the contrary, in a concave mirror, the reflecting surface bulges inwards. The main difference between a convex and concave mirror lies in the image formed by the two mirrors, i.e. while convex mirror forms diminished image, the concave mirror either forms an enlarged image or a diminished one, depending upon the position of the object. In Convex mirrors , images are erect, i.e. straight, and smaller in size. Whereas in Concave mirrors, the image is inverted. another observation is,  in Convex mirrors, image looks near and in concave the image looks far. Concave mirrors are used to see the enlarged images. These are used by doctors to examine eyes, nose, teeth etc. These also used as torch reflectors or headlights of vehicles. Convex mirrors are used as side mirrors in vehicles, as they help to see the traffic behind, and forms the image of larger spread."

If the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is concave, it is called a concave mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex, then it is a convex mirror. They are used for different applications as per the properties they own. We generally see Concave mirrors used for viewing the enlarged images of eyes, ears, teeth etc. by the doctors. While Convex mirrors are found used as side mirrors, as they form a larger view. Convex lens, as per their shape, converges the light falling on it. While concave lens diverges the light. Convex mirrors deflect light and , in Concave mirrors the light is concentrated at one point."
,"If the reflecting surface is bulge outside, its called a convex mirror. On the other hand, if the reflecting surface is bent inward, its called a Concave mirror. These are two types of spherical mirrors. In Convex mirrors, the light is concentrated at one place, and make the image to appear smaller. On the other hand, a Concave mirror deflect the light and make the image look bigger. Convex mirrors used by doctors to see the enlarged images of eyes, ears, teeth etc. by the doctors. While Convex mirrors are found used as side mirrors, as they form a larger view."
